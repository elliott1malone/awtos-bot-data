  "Measure Water Pipe or Cold Water Pipe": "Step-by-Step Instructions:\n\n1. Measure the Outside Diameter (OD): Place the tape measure across the end of the pipe (edge to edge). Record the distance in inches or millimeters. ðŸ‘‰ This is the Outside Diameter (OD).\n\nðŸ’¡ If you canâ€™t access the pipe end, wrap a string once around the pipe, mark where it overlaps, measure the length of the string, then divide by 3.14 (Ï€) to find the diameter.\n\n2. Identify the Pipe Type: Determine if your pipe is metal (iron, copper, steel) or plastic (PVC, CPVC, PEX). The type matters because pipe sizes are labeled differently depending on the material.\n\n3. Use a Pipe Size Chart: Match your Outside Diameter (OD) to a nominal pipe size on a chart for your pipe material.\nExample:\n- If OD = 1.315\", thatâ€™s 1\" nominal PVC pipe.\n- If OD = 0.84\", thatâ€™s Â½\" nominal PVC pipe.\n\n4. (Optional) Measure Inside Diameter (ID): If the pipe is open, you can also measure inside edge to inside edge. This helps confirm your result, especially for metal pipes where wall thickness varies.\n\nâœ… Quick Example: You measure across a PVC pipe and get 1.05 inches. Look at a PVC size chart â†’ thatâ€™s a Â¾-inch nominal pipe.",

  "Verbiage for Competitors": "The AWTOS System by Orion180 stands out in the smart water protection market for its practicality, affordability, and unique insurance integration that ensures customers receive full value â€” not just a discount.\n\nKey Talking Points:\n\n- Compact and Efficient Design: AWTOS is under a foot long, making it easy to install in tight spaces. Its compact build doesnâ€™t compromise performance or reliability.\n\n- Professional-Grade Compatibility: Adapter-ready for any licensed plumber, the system was engineered for straightforward installation without requiring specialized fittings or brand-specific components.\n\n- Exceptional Value: Offered at a fraction of the cost of other automatic shut-off systems, AWTOS provides advanced protection without the premium price tag.\n\n- Built for Real Homes: While designed for indoor installation only, AWTOS is made to deliver lasting performance where it matters most â€” inside the home, protecting plumbing at its source.\n\n- True Coverage Advantage: With Orion180, homeowners donâ€™t just receive a discount for installing the device â€” they gain 100% coverage on water damage protection through their policy.\n\n- Continuous Monitoring: AWTOS provides live monitoring, ensuring your system is always active, responsive, and giving you the full value of your investment.\n\n- Ownership that Lasts: Once installed, the device is entirely yours â€” no rental fees, no returns, and no ongoing hardware costs.

  "Verbiage Installation": "The AWTOS system must be installed at the main water entry point â€” typically just outside where the main line enters the home â€” because thatâ€™s where the entire homeâ€™s water supply can be monitored most effectively. Installing the device at this location ensures complete coverage of your homeâ€™s plumbing system, allowing the AWTOS to detect leaks or abnormal flow before water reaches any fixtures, softeners, or the water heater.\n\nItâ€™s very important to note that the AWTOS device itself is not waterproof or weather resistant, so even when installed near the main line outside, it must be placed in a covered or protected area, such as inside a utility box, crawl space, or indoor section of the line before it enters the home.\n\nInstalling it too far inside the home or after the plumbing splits could leave parts of your system unprotected, while installing it fully exposed outdoors could risk water or weather damage to the unit.\n\nBy ensuring itâ€™s placed at the main line entry point in a dry, protected area, you guarantee:\n\nâœ… Full-home monitoring and leak detection\nâœ… Accurate automatic shut-off response\nâœ… Safe, long-lasting performance of the device\n\nThis installation method follows standard plumbing practice and ensures the AWTOS system can do its job â€” protecting your entire home from costly water damage, safely and reliably."
